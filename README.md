# Spectral-Distributions-of-Sparse-Random-Graphs-and-Matrices

This repository contains all numerical results and MATLAB code related to the Yale-NUS capstone project "Spectral Distributions of Sparse Random Graphs and Matrices".

For our reproduction of the numerical results in Spiridonov (2010) and Zhao (2012), please see the folder "Spectral Decay Simulations". 

For our own results on the characteristic polynomials of trees, please see the folder "Tree Simulations". Within the folder, we calculate the characteristic polynomials of small trees explicitly ("Characteristic Polynomials"). We provide visualizations of both the coefficients of all trees on k vertices for small k ("Visualization of Coefficients") and of the ratios of adjacent coefficients ("Visualization og Coefficients"). 

For questions, please contact Lukas.Fesser@u.yale-nus.edu.sg .
